<p>The cache API enables plugins to read, write, and remove objects in the Traffic Server cache. All cache APIs are keyed by an object called an TSCacheKey; cache keys are created via TSCacheKeyCreate; keys are destroyed via TSCacheKeyDestroy. Use TSCacheKeyDigestSet to set the hash of the cache key.</p>

<p>Note that the cache APIs differentiate between HTTP data and plugin data. The cache APIs do not allow you to write HTTP docs in the cache; you can only write plugin-specific data (a specific type of data that differs from the HTTP type).</p>

<p><pre>
const unsigned char *key_name = "example key name";

TSCacheKey key;
TSCacheKeyCreate (&amp;key);
TSCacheKeyDigestSet (key, (unsigned char *) key_name , strlen(key_name));
TSCacheKeyDestroy (key);
</pre>
</p>

<h3>How to Do a Cache Read</h3>
<p>TSCacheRead does not really read - it is used for lookups (see the sample Protocol plugin). Possible callback events include:</p>

<p>
    <ul>

        <li>TS_EVENT_CACHE_OPEN_READ - indicates the lookup was successful. The data passed back along with this event is a cache vconnection that can be used to initiate a read on this keyed data.

        <li>TS_EVENT_CACHE_OPEN_READ_FAILED - indicates the lookup was unsuccessful. Reasons for this event could be that another continuation is writing to that cache location, or the cache key doesnâ€™t refer to a cached resource. Data payload for this event indicates the possible reason the read failed (TSCacheError).
    </ul></p>
